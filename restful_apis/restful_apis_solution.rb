# If we made an API for events happening in San Francisco... 
# 1) What would be the HTTP verb and url combination that would retrieve a list of all events?


# 2) What would be the HTTP verb and url combination that would retrieve the event with id of 4?


# 3) If you saw the HTTP verb and url combination "POST /events", using REST principles what action would it be performing?
