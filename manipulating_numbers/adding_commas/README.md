# Exercise - Adding Commas

![so many commas](resources/so_many_commas.jpg)

Ruby is great in many ways however sometimes we need a method that doesn't exist. Today, we need to format an integer to include commas so it's easier to read bigger numbers.

Example:

```ruby
add_commas(5)       # => "5"
add_commas(299)     # => "299"
add_commas(1818)    # => "1,818"
add_commas(9999999) # => "9,999,999"
```

### Goals

1. Break problem into implementable pseudocode
2. Model real world example in ruby
3. Iterate through a data with loops and variables
4. Use if statements and conditionals
5. Work with Data Structures such as `Integer`, `String`, `Array` and/or `Hash`
6. Use `p` statements to debug

# Commit 0 - Research

Use the `p` keyword to print out the data at different times in your code to help with debugging. Note: `p` works differently then `puts`. `puts` is for attractive user-friendly printing to the terminal but we are not users, we are coders and coders need more information. Run the [p_vs_puts_example.rb](examples/p_vs_puts_example.rb) in your terminal.

You do not need to research on these data structures before starting this exercise but if you need information, reference the ruby docs to find factory methods.

Write some runner code that tests the following examples

- no commas, one number character
- no commas, many number characters
- one comma
- many commas

# Commit 4 - Refactor Solution
